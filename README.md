# [GoShop](https://go-shop-nqnboy9fo-jesusborjas006.vercel.app/)

## Abstract:
GoShop is an online e-commerce site built during Mod 4 of Turing School of Software & Design. This project was intended for me to keep my React skills sharp and implement React Router to dynamically render components based on the URL path. User's can add items to their cart and checkout by confirming their order. The data can be filtered by category as shown in the sidebar and display the amount of items available at the top of the page. Application is fully responsive for multiple devices and has an 100% lighthouse score for accessibility.
